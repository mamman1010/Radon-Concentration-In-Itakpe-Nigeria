<H1>Radon Concentrations in Itakpe Iron Ore Mines And its Environs</H1>

Show using data collected from 70 different locations regions
that have a high radon conetent in drinking water. Primary
data is used. Contact mammanharuna@gmail.com for the data.

<H4>Installation</H4>

<H4>Download the data</H4>

*Get into the folder using cd Radiation coordinates in Itakpe

*Run mkdir data

*Switch into the data directory using cd data

*Request for data from the email above 

*Extract data by running rm *.zip

*Switch back into Radiation coordinates in Itakpe by running 
cd ...

<H4>Install Necessary Requirements</H4>

*Installations can be done using pip istall name where name
is the required module. An example is pip istall folium.

*Be sure you are running python 3

<H4>Moving further</H4>

To extend this work, here are a few basci steps:
*Get more smaples and sample locations (Sampling will have to be done
using a RAD7 device to get other values).

*You could get samples in different seasons of the year to make a plot of 
seasonal variations.

*Folium map can be worked on to show basic plots in all sample locations.
